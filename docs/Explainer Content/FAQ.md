# About FoundryDAO
## What is FoundryDAO?
FoundryDAO is a for profit DAO that seeks to fund and profit from ventures in the blockchain space.
## What does DAO mean?
DAOs are Distributed Autonomous Organizations. They are entities that live on the blockchain and directed by their smart contract code. There are several forms of DAOs. Blockchains (like Ethereum and Bitcoin) themselves are DAOs. DAOs typically incentivise people to act in a certain manner to further the interests of the DAO.  

Taking Ethereum as an example. Ethereum incentivises users to use it by allowing them to run autonomous smart contracts and transfer value on a neutral platform. It charges these users a fee for doing this. The fee (and a block reward) are used to incentivize miners to run the Ethereum Software. Holders of Ethereum are incentivised to improve and market the system to increase the value of their Ether. By using carefully structured incentives, without being controlled by a single entity, Ethereum can grow and further itself. 

## What is FoundryDAO meant to accomplish?
To house and capture value from beneficial, but perhaps controversial, projects (such as SmokeSignal). Many existing funds can either not be associated with such projects or not gain financial benefit from such projects. FoundryDAO seeks to be able to do both. 

## How does FoundryDAO work?
FoundryDAO allows Foundry Token (FRY) holders to participate in a liquid democracy governance system where users can vote on proposals submitted to the Foundry for funding. Every token vote is equally weighted and users can specialize in governance matters by having others delegate tokens to them. These tokens will still belong 100% to the original holders but the user who has been delegated to will have a bigger say in if proposals are passed or declined.

## Where does FoundryDAO get money?
FoundryDAO will get it's initial funding from the a token presale. The funds raised in the presale will go to the FoundryDAO treasury where they will be under the control of the Foundry governance mechanism. 

FoundryDAO will, after it's initial presale, enter a "perpetual sale" where FRY tokens will continuously be sold of for funds. This sale will dilute existing holder at a rate of 5% per year but preserve the value of their FRY tokens by increasing the FoundryDAO treasury by an equivalent amount. This will also maximally distribute Foundry's membership making it hard for early participants to monopolize but at the same time rewarding them for their early support. 

FoundryDAO's cash flow come from the project incomes that it has invested in. These will predominantly be dApps on the Ethereum blockchain. If FRY token holders act wisely the treasury will grow, if they act poorly it will shrink.

## What is liquid democracy?
Liquid democracy is a form of member managed governance that negates the need for a "manager" or "executive" tier in the organization, but allows for fine grained specialization to form. It works by allowing users to delegate their voting power to other users who they deem as prudent and informed about the proposals brought to the Foundry. Those users could themselves then re-delegate those votes to yet other users. This is beneficial in that it allows users to specialize in getting proficient at governance, while allowing people who do not wish to become experts in FoundryDAO's affairs to still invest, but seed their voting power with someone they trust.
