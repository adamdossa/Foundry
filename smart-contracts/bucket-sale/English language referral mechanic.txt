How the referral program works.

We believe in the exchange of value for value, therefore the Foundry referral program is set up to incentivize the
inclusion of participants motivated to see the project succeed as token holders. The Foundry sale referral program
rewards people who market the sale by giving them a percentage of the value that the person they referred, entered
into the sale. It rewards the person who was referred by giving them extra FRY tokens.

What is the referral reward for a buyer?
For someone entering the sale with someone else's referral code, they get 10% extra. This 10% is allocated to them
as a seperate purchase in the next bucket from the bucket they are entering. 

What is the referral reward for the referrer?
Referral rewards are calculated for the referrer based on amount of DAI the referred buyer is spending to purchase
FRY. This amount scales from 10% to 100% based on the total amount of DAI the referrer's code has already 
generated for the sale. The percentage starts at 10% and gains 1% for every $1,000 the referrer code brings to the
sale. So if someone purchases $5,000 with your referral code, that means you will get 10% + 5% of the value they 
purchased in the next sale bucket. So in this example it would be similar to you buying $160 in the next bucket.
Your reward percentage keeps growing to a maximimum of 100% once your referral code reaches $100,000 brought into
the sale. 

Can I use my own referral code?
Yes, you can buy FRY by using your own referral code. This will give you both the 10% buyer reward and the
referral code in the next sale bucket.
